    <P>This is Kevin
    Montuori's <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/ignavusinfo/trivial-ldap/">trivial-ldap</a>,
    with a few modifications. Details and
    code <a href="http://github.com/rwiker/trivial-ldap">here</a>.</P>

    <H4>HP41 Barcode Generator</H4>
    <P>Way back in 1985, I had an HP41 calculator with a barcode wand,
    but I didn't have a way of generating barcodes for it. In 2011,
    after upgrading my HP41
    to <a href="http://systemyde.com/hp41">HP41CL</a>
    (basically, replacing the
    processor board with a modern implementation that runs faster and
    includes a huge amount of the software written for the HP41), I
    wrote a barcode generator that uses HTML, javascript and SVG. Code
    <a href="http://github.com/rwiker/hp41barcode">here</a>,
    with an on-line
    demo <a href="http://rwiker.github.com/hp41barcode">here</a>. 

    <H4>HP41CL-Stuff</H4>
    <P>Two simple utilities named <strong>CLWriter.exe</strong>
    and <strong>CLReader.exe</strong>. These are trivial .NET
    programs, and hence only work under
    Windows. Code <a href="http://rwiker.github.com/HP41CL-Stuff">here</a>.
    </P>
