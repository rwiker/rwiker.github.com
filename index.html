    <H4>HP41 Barcode Generator</H4>
    <P>Way back in 1985, I had an HP41 calculator with a barcode wand,
    but I didn't have a way of generating barcodes for it. In 2011,
    after upgrading my HP41 to HP41CL (basically, replacing the
    processor board with a modern implementation that runs faster and
    includes a huge amount of the software written for the HP41), I
    wrote a barcode generator that uses HTML, javascript and SVG. Code
    <a href="http://github.com/rwiker/hp41barcode">here</a>,
    with an on-line
    demo <a href="http://rwiker.github.com/hp41barcode">here</a>.
